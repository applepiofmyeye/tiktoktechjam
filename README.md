Hi my name is Joey. This is my submission for the TikTok Techjam 2024.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

The left hand side of the screen has been designed to simulate a phone. You may use the buttons below to navigate around the website, and there are 3 demo flows to follow

Flow 1: This or That create

1. In the shoppingListSlug page, add a feature to add a this or that and ask them to add the 2 products, title and username of the person they want to send to.

adding a product to shopping list

1. view a product (home page),
2. then add to shopping list using the shopping bag icon.
3. then head to profile and you should see the item you want there.

Flow 2: adding a product to a video (from creators pov)

1. go to add page
2. click link Item
3. search for the item.
4. for future implementation: when there is no item in the list but it is mentioned in the video, it can be added to the database, but with a flag to signal it is not an actual product.
5. exit
6. delete item
7. also for future implementation: link more than one item.

Flow 3:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
